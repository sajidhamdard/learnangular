## **Versioning in `package.json`**

In the `package.json` file, when you specify a version for a package, you can use **semver (semantic versioning)**. The version is written like this:

```
major.minor.patch
```

For example:
`6.6.0`

* **Major (6)**: Breaking changes or major updates.
* **Minor (6)**: New features, but backwards-compatible.
* **Patch (0)**: Bug fixes or patches, backwards-compatible.

---

### **The Use of `~` and `^`**

#### 1️⃣ **Tilde (`~`)**

When you use **`~`**, it allows updates to the **patch version** (the third number) but **not the minor version**.

**Example:**
`~6.6.0` means:

* Will install **6.6.x**, where `x` is any patch version.
* Will **not update to 6.7.x** or higher.

**Behavior**:

* It locks the version to `6.6.x`, but allows patch updates, for example `6.6.1`, `6.6.2`, etc.

---

#### 2️⃣ **Caret (`^`)**

When you use **`^`**, it allows updates to the **minor and patch versions**, but **not the major version**.

**Example:**
`^6.6.0` means:

* Will install any version that is \*\*`>=6.6.0` and <7.0.0`** (meaning `6.x.x\` versions).
* Will **not update to 7.0.0** or higher.

**Behavior**:

* It allows updates to both the **minor** and **patch** versions. For example, it will update to `6.7.0` or `6.6.1`, but **won't go to `7.0.0`**.

---

### **Why Use `~` and `^`?**

* **`~`** is used when you only want **patch fixes** (like bug fixes) but don’t want new features or potential breaking changes.
* **`^`** is used when you want to stay **within the same major version** but still get the latest **minor updates** (i.e., new features without breaking compatibility).

---

### **What Does `6.6.0` Actually Mean?**

* `6` = **Major version**

  * A breaking change would occur if it moves to `7.0.0`.
* `6` = **Minor version**

  * Adding new features without breaking compatibility would move it to `6.7.0`, `6.8.0`, etc.
* `0` = **Patch version**

  * Fixing bugs or minor changes without breaking the API moves it to `6.6.1`, `6.6.2`, etc.

---

### **Example in `package.json`**

```json
"dependencies": {
  "lodash": "^6.6.0",  // Will update to 6.x.x, but not 7.x.x
  "axios": "~0.21.0"   // Will update to 0.21.x, but not 0.22.x
}
```

---

### **Summary of Key Points**

* **`^`** allows updates to **minor** and **patch** versions (but **not** major).
* **`~`** allows updates to **patch** versions only.
* **Version `6.6.0`** means:

  * Major version: 6
  * Minor version: 6
  * Patch version: 0
